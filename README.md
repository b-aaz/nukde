# Nukde
A Desktop environment brought to life by the [Nuklear](https://github.com/Immediate-Mode-UI/Nuklear) toolkit 
and written in C

# Why ?
I was tired with the state of bloated toolkits and the desktop environments
based on them .  So i decided to start writing my own in my free time .

The goal of this project is to make a DE witch is simple, fast, modular,
minimal and easily configurable; Also witch is respectful to the UNIX ideas 
but with modern looks .
I also want to try doing things in new ways that may not be with total 
adherence with the classic desktop metaphor .

This project currently only supports FreeBSD . 

## Things done:
+ Have Wrote the Nukdesk a desktop program .
+ Have Wrote the Nuksu a pkexe like graphical program but simple .
+ The desktop is 50% done . And is in a near usable state .
+ The Nuksu program is done but the code is not really clean .

## Features:
+ Modular
+ Simple and universal configuration format
+ Respects the UNIX philosophy
+ Small
+ Fast (I hope)

## New things:
+ Nukmenu : A simple and small menu program inspired by 9menu
