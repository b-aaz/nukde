# Nukde
A Desktop environment based on the [Nuklear](https://github.com/Immediate-Mode-UI/Nuklear) toolkit 
and written in C

# So....
I was tired with the state of the bloated toolkits and desktop environments based on them .
so i decided to start writing my own in my free time .

The goal of this project is to make a DE witch is fast, modular and minimal (like really minimal) with modern looks and bells and whistles. 
I planned this DE to be BSD specific and I have no intention or motive to port it to Linux .

## Things done:
+ The desktop is 70% done. and is in a near usable state
+ The Nuksu program is done but is not really clean .
## TODOS:
+ Comment this slab of code
+ Write a nice Makefile
+ Move the nuksu from xlib to opengl 
+ Complete the desktop
+ Move to ANSI C
+ and a BIG MORE .....
