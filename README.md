# Nukde
A Desktop environment based on the [Nuklear](https://github.com/Immediate-Mode-UI/Nuklear) toolkit 
and written in C

# So....
I was tired with the state of the bloated toolkits and desktop environments based on them .
So i decided to start writing my own in my free time .

The goal of this project is to make a DE witch is fast, modular and minimal (like really minimal) with modern looks and bells and whistles. 
I've intended to write this DE to be a BSD specific DE and I have no intention or motive to port it to Linux .

## Things done:
+ Have Wrote the Nukdesk a desktop program .
+ Have Wrote the Nuksu a pkexe like graphical program but simple .
+ The desktop is 50% done. And is in a near usable state .
+ The Nuksu program is done but the code is not really clean .

## Features:
+ Modular
+ Simple and universal configuration format
+ Respects the UNIX philosophy
+ Small
+ fast (I hope at least)

## New things:
+ Nukmenu : A simple and small menu program inspired by 9menu


## TODOS:
+ Document the programs []
+ Comment this slab of code [@]
+ Write some nice Makefiles [X]
+ Move nuksu from Xlib to opengl [] 
+ Complete the desktop [@]
+ Move to ANSI C []
+ Test on (Open&Net)BSD []
+ Segment the functions in different files [X]
+ and a BIG MORE .....
